            <p>Hello! I'm McKayla McAllister, aspiring data analyst. With a background in data science and automation, I bring 4 years of academic expertise in analytics and databases. My journey began with pursing a degree in Informatics at Indiana University in Indianapolis, where I developed a deep passion for communication and helping people. Driven by a fascination for statistics, I thrive on being able to increase efficiency and output. While I was at university, I was lucky enough to graduate with three certificates and minor in addition to my degree, which I earned with highest distinction.</p>

            <p>Beyond work, I enjoy video games, finding inspiration in how certain games manage high numbers of modifiers to damage, always applying everything correctly. I am committed to transparency and honesty, striving to do the best that I can within the given parameters of any project.</p>
            <p>Explore my portfolio to see my data analysis projects, and feel free to reach out to discuss job opportunities.</p>
