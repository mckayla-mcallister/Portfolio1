             <h3>University Organization System</h3>
             <p>A Microsoft Access database that allows administration to track students, instructors, classes, and enrollment status. During the course of this project, I developed a scalable and user-friendly database system to organize the information in third normal form (3NF). I created efficient queries to find specific information, such as enrollment information or which classes are held in a certain building. I enabled non-technical individuals to enter data via form creation, and I generated a report of active enrollment for easy access.</p>

             <h3>Evaluating Potential Bias in Data</h3>
             <p>This project explores the potential bias of the data in adult.data. By creating models for each gender tag separately, creating one model for the combined dataset, and then comparing the accuracy of each model, we can begin to understand whether or not the different machine learning models tested locate bias within the data. The goal was to compare different machine learning analysis methods to find out which, if any, will pick up on potential biases in the data. Ideally, a machine learning method should be at least 90% accurate. In this dataset, the models are attempting to distinguish whether or not a given person makes more than $50,000 per year. The two models tested are neural networks and decision trees. The models were created based on one protected variable at a time (in this case, there is a “male” and “female” model). That way, we have the accuracy for each value of the protected variable, and we can calculate how different they are from each other to attempt to determine if the bias is too steep for our data. It is important to remember that while methods can be biased, it is also possible that the data that we are using is biased.</p>
